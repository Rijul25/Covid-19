# Covid-19
A machine learning algorithm used to Detect whether a patient has COVID 19 or not . 

# Here is the dataset links - >
Covid X-Ray Image Datase. ->>  https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-che... for positive cases.

Kaggle X-Ray Chest Images ->> https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymoo... 
for negative cases.

We will detect COVID-19 from Chest X-Rays by building a Simple Convolution Neural Network.
